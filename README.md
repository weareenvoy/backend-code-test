# Backend-Engineer Code Test
The Envoy Group Backend-Engineer Code Test. This test is used to assess required technical skills, problem solving and ability.

### Objective
Build an application that consumes a third-party API, performs CRUD operations on a data store and renders at least one client-side view.

### Required Technologies
- NodeJS
- Google Firebase

### NodeJS
Utilize [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to create and satisfy the outlined objective above.

### Google Firebase
Utilize [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products) to store and query data. The basic requirement is to use Firebase functionality to create a data store. Feel free to include other Firebase products/technologies should you see a need to do so.

### Third-Party API
Utilize the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/) to power your application.

### Application Requirements
Create an application that will allow users to vote for their favorite Marvel character. The user will be given a *RANDOM* set of *THREE* characters to vote on.

- Voting sessions should produce a randomized set of three characters
- User can vote for a character
- User can only vote once
- Voting data should persist between sessions
- All sessions should update in real-time
- Allow for the sharing of a given unique voting session
- Store voting data in Firebase
- Implement basic logging for all operations and errors

### More on logging
The only requirement for logging: log all of the applications processes to a local file.

### Packages, Frameworks and Tools
You are allowed to use any third-party packages, frameworks and technologies that you believe would aid in the development time, performance, structure, maintainability and would overall improve the application as a whole.

### Client-Side View(s)
You are required to include at least one client-side view(user voting). While HTML, CSS and frontend JavaScript is important, that is not the primary goal of this exercise. With that being said, we do not expect to see a pixel perfect client-side view but we also do not want to discourage any imagination or inspiration. Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the client-side view as you want. Please leverage any frameworks or libraries of your choosing. We will not provide any designs for the required view and *your client-side design will not affect overall assessment of this exercise*.
