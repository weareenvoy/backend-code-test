# Marvel Application

### Objective
Build an application that consumes a third-party API, performs CRUD operations on a data store and renders at least one client-side view.

### Required Technologies
- NodeJS
- Google Firebase

### NodeJS
Utilize [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to create and satisfy the outlined objective above.

### Google Firebase
Utilize [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products) to store and query data. The basic requirement is to use Firebase functionality to create a data store. Feel free to include other Firebase products/technologies should you see a need to do so.

### Third-Party API
Utilize the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/) to power your application.

### Application Requirements
Create an application that will allow users to vote for their favorite Marvel character. The user will be given a RANDOM set of THREE characters to vote on.

- Voting sessions should produce a randomized set of three Marvel characters
- User can vote for a character
- User can only vote once per voting session
- Voting data should persist between & across sessions
- All sessions should update, detect, and re-render data-store changes in real-time
- Allow for the sharing of a given unique voting session (see 'sharing' note below)
- Store voting data in Firebase
- Implement basic logging for all operations and errors

### More on sharing
Allow for sharing of a unique voting session. **This DOES NOT mean any kind of social media sharing**. It simple means generate and display shareable urls.

### More on logging
The only requirement for logging: log all of the applications processes to a local file.

### Packages, Frameworks and Tools
You are allowed to use any third-party packages, frameworks and technologies that you believe would aid in the development time, performance, structure, maintainability and would overall improve the application as a whole.

### Client-Side View(s)
You are required to include at least one client-side view(user voting). While HTML, CSS and frontend JavaScript is important, that is not the primary goal of this exercise. With that being said, we do not expect to see a pixel perfect client-side view but we also do not want to discourage any imagination or inspiration. Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the client-side view as you want. Please leverage any frameworks or libraries of your choosing. We will not provide any designs for the required view and **your client-side design will not affect overall assessment of this exercise**.

### Application Context
This application should be treated as an MVP or POC. We understand that you may or may not need to take certains steps that would **NOT** apply to a production environment. This is ok, all that we ask is that you are aware, able to explain these steps and appropriately flag these decisions.

### Submitting your application
Please create a **PUBLIC** github repository. We encourage you to go through your normal development process when creating this application. **There is no need to deploy this application to any sort of remote environment and we do not expect you to do so**. Please ensure that you have proper instructions of how to access, install and run your application.

### Constructive comments
Don't overthink the process or the application. At the same time, please do consider project structure, code cleanliness, extensibility, documentation and overall software composition. There's no "recommended amount of time" that should be spent on this. In recieving this test, we at Envoy have already agreed that you have an adequate level of experience and knowledge. We want to see that experience and knowledge translate to the level of discernment and practical application that we're looking for here at Envoy. The ability to architect and compose software at a level that promotes consistency, maintaibilty, extensibility and at the lowest level works correctly. **Have fun with this project**. You're welcome to go as far as your imagination and enjoyment of programming takes you.

### Questions, comments, concerns and constructive feedback
Do not hesitate to reach out with any questions concerning the outline above. Envoy is always trying to improve and grow our hiring process. Please feel free to express any comments, criticisms, concerns and feedback.
